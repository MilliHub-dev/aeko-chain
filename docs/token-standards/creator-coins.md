# Creator Coins

Creator Coins are a special subset of AEKO-20 tokens bonded to a **Bonding Curve**.

## Bonding Curve Mechanism

*   **Price Discovery**: The price of the coin increases as the supply increases (and vice versa).
*   **Instant Liquidity**: Users can always buy or sell against the curve; no counterparty is needed.
*   **Formula**: $Price = m \times Supply^n$

## Use Cases

1.  **Gated Content**: Hold 10 $ALICE to see Alice's private posts.
2.  **Priority DM**: Burn 1 $BOB to send a direct message to Bob.
3.  **Revenue Share**: Coin holders earn a % of the creator's ad revenue.
