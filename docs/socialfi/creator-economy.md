# Creator Economy

AEKO Chain empowers creators with financial tools previously reserved for corporations.

## Creator Coins
Every user can launch their own **Creator Coin** (AEKO-20).
*   **Bonding Curve**: Price increases as supply increases.
*   **Utility**: Holders get access to private channels (Gatekeeper), exclusive content, or voting rights on the creator's future content.

## Content Collectibles
Creators can mint their best posts as **Limited Edition NFTs**.
*   *Example*: A viral video mints 1,000 "Signed Copies". Fans buy them to own a piece of history.
*   *Royalties*: If those copies trade on the secondary market, the creator gets a % forever.

## Subscriptions
On-chain recurring payments.
*   Users approve a "Subscription Stream" (e.g., 5 AEKO / month).
*   The smart contract automatically pulls funds and grants access tokens.
