# Reward Model

AEKO Chain incentivizes positive network behavior through a dual-reward system.

## 1. Proof of Engagement (PoE)
Users earn **Engagement Points** (convertible to AEKO) for:
*   Creating high-quality content (measured by unique engagement).
*   Curating content (liking/reposting early before a post goes viral).
*   *Anti-Abuse*: The "Quality Score" algorithm filters out spam/bot farms using the Identity Layer.

## 2. Validator Rewards
Validators earn standard block rewards, but can earn a **Social Bonus** for:
*   Indexing social data efficiently.
*   Providing low-latency RPC endpoints for social apps.

## 3. Creator Payouts
*   **Direct Tipping**: 100% goes to creator.
*   **Ad Revenue Share**: If ads are shown in the Aeko App, 70% of the revenue buys back AEKO and distributes it to the creators whose content was viewed.
