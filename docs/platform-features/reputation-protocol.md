# Reputation Protocol

Reputation is the "currency of trust" on AEKO Chain. It determines your influence in governance and your visibility in social feeds.

## Earning Reputation

1.  **Creation**: Posting high-quality content that receives likes/tips.
2.  **Curation**: Early upvoting of content that later goes viral.
3.  **Holding**: Staking AEKO tokens for long periods (Time-Weighted).

## Losing Reputation (Slashing)

1.  **Spamming**: Sending too many transactions that fail or are reported.
2.  **Sybil Attacks**: Attempting to create multiple fake identities.
3.  **Downvotes**: Consistent negative feedback from high-reputation users.
