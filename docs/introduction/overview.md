# AEKO Developer Documentation

Welcome to the official developer documentation for **AEKO** — a high-performance blockchain ecosystem powering **SocialFi, secure communications, digital identity, and on-chain creator economies**.

AEKO consists of two primary layers:

1. **AEKO Chain** – A Solana-VM–based Layer-1 blockchain optimized for speed, security, and parallel execution.
2. **AEKO Social** – A standalone Node.js–based social platform that integrates with AEKO Chain through cryptographic signatures and verification proofs.

This documentation is intended for:
- Blockchain developers
- Backend engineers
- dApp builders
- Wallet & SDK developers
- Security engineers
- Researchers and auditors

If you are new, start with **Vision** → **Architecture Overview** → **Chain Basics**.
