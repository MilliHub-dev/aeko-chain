# Overview

**AEKO Chain** is a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain specifically engineered to bridge the gap between high-frequency social interaction and high-security financial/enterprise compliance. Built on a modified **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)** runtime, AEKO Chain offers the throughput required for social media (thousands of transactions per second) while introducing a novel **Permission Layer** and **Content Signature Layer** not found in general-purpose chains.

## Why AEKO Chain?

Traditional blockchains are often optimized for one of two things:
1.  **DeFi**: High security, high cost, low throughput.
2.  **Gaming/NFTs**: High throughput, variable security, limited programmability for identity.

AEKO Chain targets a third vertical: **Verifiable Social Trust**.

### Core Value Props

*   **Content Authenticity**: Native primitives for hashing and signing content (posts, videos, messages) to prove authorship and integrity.
*   **Graduated Permissions**: A single chain that can handle public permissionless traffic (social media) and private permissioned traffic (military/enterprise) via its Multi-Tier Permission Layer.
*   **SocialFi Economics**: Gas and fee models optimized for micro-transactions (tipping, liking) rather than just heavy financial swaps.

## The AEKO Difference

| Feature | Ethereum/EVM | Solana/SVM | AEKO Chain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Throughput** | Low | High | **High** |
| **Identity** | Wallet Address | Wallet Address | **Reputation & ID Layer** |
| **Content** | Arbitrary Data (expensive) | Arbitrary Data | **Native Content Primitives** |
| **Permissions** | Public Only | Public Only | **Hybrid (Public/Private/Sovereign)** |
