# AEKO Vision

## The Problem

Modern digital platforms suffer from:
- Fake accounts and impersonation
- Misinformation and content manipulation
- Platform-controlled creator monetization
- Centralized censorship
- Insecure communication channels
- Lack of verifiable digital identity

At the same time, blockchain platforms often:
- Lack real user adoption
- Are too slow or expensive
- Are disconnected from real-world applications
