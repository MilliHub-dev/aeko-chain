Moderation & Audit Model
Important Distinction

❗ Moderation ≠ Censorship

Aeko does not erase truth.
It manages visibility.

| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Social Backend   | Content visibility   |
| Permission Layer | Action authorization |
| Chain            | Immutable records    |
